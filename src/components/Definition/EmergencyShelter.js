    <p>
      This category refers to facilities with temporary, overnight sleeping accommodations. Some operate year-round as dedicated homeless shelters, others offer shelter temporarily in churches, schools, and community centers during winter months or on nights when there is severe weather. Some serve any person in need while others offer beds to specific groups, such as women with children, or veterans. On the night of January 28, 2015, 872 of the 3,801 who met the HUD definition of homelessness slept in emergency shelters.
